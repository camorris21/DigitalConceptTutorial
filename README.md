# Explaining and Exploring HTML/CSS 
**Chelsea Morris**

The purpose of this tutorial is to give a brief explanation of what exactly HTML and CSS are, as well as get you on your way to building your first webpage! This tutorial will be beneficial for those who know little to nothing about both HTML and CSS but would like to expand their knowledge and briefly explore the awesome things that they have to offer. The main focus is to take you through the downloading process of a source code editor called Brackets where you will write your code and be able to create your first web page! There will be several topics covered (many of which are strictly BASIC coverings and will NOT go into depth). Some of the following topics will be covered:

* What is HTML?
* What is CSS?
* What is Brackets?
* How do HTML and CSS go together?
* Downloading Brackets. 
* How to create a webpage.
* Examples of MY work!

# What is HTML?

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is a markup language for describing web pages. There are 5 required tags when creating a HTML document. These tags include:

1          (1)<!DOCTYPE html> 
2.         (2)<html> 
3.         (3)     <head> 
4.         (4)          <title> </title>
                  </head>
5.         (5)    <body>
     
                  </body>
 
 
            </html>
